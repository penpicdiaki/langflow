# How to Use Creative ALchemy Universal 1.00.08 By Daniel Kawakami 64 Bit to Restore EAX Effects on Windows Vista and Later
 
If you are a fan of old PC games that use EAX effects to enhance the sound quality and immersion, you may have noticed that they don't work properly on Windows Vista and later versions. This is because Microsoft removed the hardware audio acceleration feature from these operating systems, which breaks the compatibility with EAX-enabled games.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem: Creative ALchemy Universal 1.00.08 By Daniel Kawakami 64 Bit. This is a modified version of the official Creative ALchemy tool that allows you to restore EAX effects on any sound card, even if it is not from Creative. It works by converting the EAX calls into OpenAL calls, which are supported by most modern sound cards and drivers.
