# Mikroc Pro For Pic 54 Keygen: How to Get a Valid License for Your Compiler
 
Mikroc Pro For Pic is a powerful and easy-to-use compiler for PIC microcontrollers. It offers a rich set of features, such as 1045 library functions, 168 code examples, 808 supported MCUs, Visual TFT integration, hardware debugging and more[^1^]. However, to use the full potential of the compiler, you need a valid license key that unlocks all the functionalities.

There are two ways to get a valid license key for Mikroc Pro For Pic 54: either buy it from the official website[^1^] or generate it using a keygen. A keygen is a program that can create a license key based on some information about your computer and the compiler. In this article, we will show you how to use a keygen to get a valid license key for Mikroc Pro For Pic 54.
 
## Step 1: Download the keygen and the patched compiler
 
The first step is to download the keygen and the patched compiler from the links below. The keygen is a program that can generate a license key based on your computer's hard drive serial number and a magic value that is calculated by the compiler. The patched compiler is a modified version of Mikroc Pro For Pic 54 that can display the magic value when you try to compile a large code.

- Patched compiler: [http://rapidshare.de/files/30217967/OnlyForGetKey\_.rar.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/30217967/OnlyForGetKey_.rar.html)

The password for both files is www.sonsivri.com[^2^]. Unzip and unrar the files and put them in the same folder as your original Mikroc Pro For Pic 54 installation.
 
## Step 2: Generate an old-style key with the keygen
 
The next step is to generate an old-style key with the keygen. This key will pass the old check procedure of the compiler, but not the new one. To generate an old-style key, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the keygen. Then type:

    MikroC_KeyGen -pC:\\

This will create a file called MikroC.key in the same folder. Copy this file to your Mikroc Pro For Pic 54 installation folder (do not delete it from the keygen folder).
 
## Step 3: Get the magic value with the patched compiler
 
The next step is to get the magic value with the patched compiler. This value is calculated by the compiler based on some information about your computer and the license key. To get the magic value, run OnlyForGetKey!.exe from your Mikroc Pro For Pic 54 installation folder and try to compile a large code. For example, you can compile "mikroC\\Examples\\extra\_examples\\SerialEthernet". When you try to compile, you will see a message box with a number. This is your magic value. Save it somewhere and press OK. The program will exit.
 
## Step 4: Generate a new-style key with the keygen
 
The final step is to generate a new-style key with the keygen. This key will pass both the old and the new check procedures of the compiler. To generate a new-style key, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the keygen. Then type:

    MikroC_KeyGen -v

where <magic_value> is your magic value that you got from step 3. For example:</magic_value>
