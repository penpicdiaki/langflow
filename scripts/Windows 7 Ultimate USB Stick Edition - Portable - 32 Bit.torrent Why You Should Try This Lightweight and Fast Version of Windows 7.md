## How does Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition work?
 
Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition works by using a modified boot.wim file from Windows 8. This file allows the OS to boot from a removable device without requiring any installation on the hard disk. The OS also uses a RAM disk to store temporary files and cache data, which reduces the wear and tear on the USB drive and improves the speed and performance of the OS. The OS also uses a registry tweak to disable the write filter on the USB drive, which allows the OS to save changes and settings on the drive.
 
To run Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition, users need to have a USB drive with at least 8 GB of free space and a computer that supports booting from USB. Users also need to have a Windows 7 ISO file and a Rufus tool to create a bootable USB drive with the OS. The steps to create a bootable USB drive with Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition are as follows:

1. Download Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition ISO file from a trusted source.
2. Download Rufus tool from [https://rufus.ie/](https://rufus.ie/).
3. Launch Rufus and select the USB drive as the device.
4. Select "Disk or ISO image" as the boot selection and browse for the Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition ISO file.
5. Select "MBR" as the partition scheme and "BIOS or UEFI" as the target system 8cf37b1e13
