But why would you want to play as a child character in Fallout: New Vegas? Well, there are some benefits and drawbacks to this choice. Here are some of them:

- Playing as a child character can make the game more challenging and immersive, as you will face more dangers and difficulties in the harsh wasteland. You will also have to rely more on your skills, perks, and companions than on your weapons and armor.
- Playing as a child character can also open up some unique dialogue options and interactions with other characters, especially other children. You may be able to persuade, charm, or intimidate them more easily, or learn some secrets that adults won't tell you. For example, you can use the Child at Heart perk to access some cut content that was originally intended for child characters.[^3^]
- However, playing as a child character also has some disadvantages. You will be unable to use some weapons and armor that are too big or heavy for you, such as power armor, miniguns, or rocket launchers. You will also be unable to gamble, drink alcohol, use drugs, or hire prostitutes. Some characters may also treat you differently or disrespectfully because of your age.

Ultimately, playing as a child character in Fallout: New Vegas is a matter of personal preference and playstyle. Some players may enjoy the challenge and role-playing opportunities that it offers, while others may find it too frustrating or limiting. If you decide to try it out, be sure to download and install Lutana CotW Expansion mod to enhance your experience.
