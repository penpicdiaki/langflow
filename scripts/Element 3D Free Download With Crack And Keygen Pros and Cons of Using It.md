## What is Element 3D?
  
Element 3D is a plugin developed by Video Copilot, a company that specializes in creating high-quality tools and tutorials for motion designers and visual effects artists. Element 3D is designed to work with After Effects, a popular software for creating and editing video content.
  
Element 3D allows you to import 3D objects and textures from various formats, such as OBJ, C4D, and PNG. You can then manipulate and animate these objects using the plugin's interface, which is integrated with After Effects. You can also use Element 3D to create 3D particles, shadows, reflections, noise, deformations, and more.
  
Element 3D uses OpenGL technology to render the 3D objects in real time, which means you can see the results of your changes instantly. This makes Element 3D faster and more responsive than other 3D plugins that rely on ray tracing or CPU rendering. Element 3D also supports GPU rendering, which can further speed up the rendering process.
