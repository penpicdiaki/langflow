*The Kissing Booth* was originally written by Reekles when she was only 15 years old and published online on Wattpad, where it gained millions of readers and fans.

The book is told from Elle's point of view, as she narrates her life as a pretty and popular girl who has never been kissed. She has a best friend named Lee Flynn, who is Noah's younger brother and her partner in crime. They decide to run a kissing booth at their school's Spring Carnival, hoping to raise money for their dance club. However, things get complicated when Elle ends up kissing Noah, who is a badass, volatile and a total player. She feels an instant attraction to him, but she also knows that he is off-limits, since Lee has a rule that his brother is not allowed to date his friends.
 
Elle tries to keep away from Noah, but he pursues her relentlessly, showing her a softer side that no one else sees. They start a secret relationship, but they soon face challenges from their friends, families and themselves. Elle has to deal with her insecurities, Noah's jealousy and Lee's betrayal. She also has to figure out what she wants for her future and whether Noah is worth risking everything for.

Many readers and critics have praised *The Kissing Booth* for its engaging writing style, realistic dialogue and relatable characters. They have also enjoyed the chemistry between Elle and Noah, the humor and drama of their secret romance, and the twists and turns of the plot. Some of the positive reviews are:
 
- "The Kissing Booth was an easy read novel which I easily finished in a day. It is about a 16 year old girl named Rochelle, she also goes by the name Elle or Shelly. Rochelle & her best friend Lee have to come up with an idea for their booth for the carnival at school. They decide on a kissing booth which leads Rochelle to her first kiss with Lee's older brother Noah. This book was a fun read which I really enjoyed." - Goodreads review[^1^]
- "This teen romance is an amazing achievement for such a young author, who was 15 when she published it herself as an ebook, but it's for romance fans only. Bad-boy Noah and pretty, popular, every-girl Elle make a swoon-worthy couple. Narrator Elle is easy to relate to. Her friends and family are all believable, too." - Common Sense Media review[^2^]
- "If youâre looking for a teen comedy that isnât a grow-up-too-fast exposure to your tweens, Kissing Booth isnât it. But the arc of the story packs a lot of lust and relationship lessons that anybody older than 15 can relate to, and learn from." - Metacritic review[^3^]

However, not everyone has loved *The Kissing Booth*. Some readers and critics have criticized the book for its clichÃ©d plot, unrealistic scenarios and problematic messages. They have also disliked Noah's possessive and violent behavior, Elle's lack of self-respect and independence, and the lack of diversity and depth in the characters. Some of the negative reviews are:

- "I hated this book so much I wanted to throw it across the room. The main character is so annoying and stupid, she lets Noah treat her like crap and lies to her best friend. Noah is a jerk who gets into fights all the time and cheats on Elle with other girls. The plot is so predictable and boring, nothing happens except kissing and drama. The writing is terrible, full of errors and British slang that doesn't fit in California. This book is a waste of time and money." - Goodreads review[^1^]
- "The Kissing Booth is one of those books that makes me wonder how it ever got published. It's full of stereotypes, sexism and slut-shaming. The author tries to make Noah seem like a romantic hero, but he's actually an abusive creep who controls Elle's life and threatens anyone who looks at her. Elle is a pathetic heroine who has no personality or ambition, she just follows Noah around like a puppy. The plot is ridiculous and unrealistic, with no conflict or resolution. The writing is immature and sloppy, with no sense of style or voice." - Amazon review[^4^]
- "The Kissing Booth is a poorly written, poorly plotted, poorly characterized mess of a book that glorifies toxic masculinity and unhealthy relationships. It's not even funny or cute, it's just cringey and offensive. The author should be ashamed of herself for writing such garbage and promoting such harmful messages to young readers." - Barnes & Noble review
