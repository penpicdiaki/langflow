## Who is St. Rita of Cascia?
 
St. Rita of Cascia was born in 1381 in Roccaporena, a small village near Cascia, in the Umbria region of Italy. She was married at a young age to Paolo Mancini, a nobleman who was known for his violent and quarrelsome temper. Despite his behavior, Rita loved him and prayed for his conversion. She also bore him two sons, who inherited his father's vengeful attitude. Rita suffered many hardships and abuses in her marriage, but she never lost her faith and hope in God.
 
One day, Paolo was ambushed and killed by his enemies. Rita's sons swore to avenge their father's death, but Rita prayed that God would take them away rather than let them commit murder. Her prayers were answered when both of her sons died of natural causes within a year. Rita was left alone and without any support. She decided to enter the convent of St. Mary Magdalene in Cascia, but she was rejected three times because she was a widow and because her family was involved in a feud with another clan. However, Rita did not give up and miraculously obtained the permission to join the convent after she was visited by three saints: St. John the Baptist, St. Augustine, and St. Nicholas of Tolentino.
